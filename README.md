## Basic RAG Pipeline
<img width="1206" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c69c0595-124d-4ed0-9766-d86eb98eceaa">

It's like a simple question-and-answer system:

- **Query**: A user asks a question.
- **Retrieval**: We search our knowledge base for relevant info.
- **Generation**: A language model uses the retrieved info and the query to create an answer.
- **Response**: The answer is given back to the user.

- **Query**: A user asks a question.
- **Query Enhancement**: We'll make the user's question even better before searching for information. This helps us find more relevant results.
- **Retrieval** (same as before): We still search for relevant information.
- **Re-ranking**: We don't just want any relevant info, we want the most relevant info. This step helps us prioritize the best results.
- **Generation** (same as before): Our language model creates an answer using the prioritized information and the enhanced query.
- **Response** **Validation**: Before giving the answer to the user, we double-check it. Is it accurate? Does it make sense? Does it answer the question?
- **Response** (same as before): Finally, the answer is given to the user.

## 80/20 Rule

In building [Wandbot](https://github.com/wandb/wandbot/), W&B leveraged the 80/20 rule, roughly 80% of user queries can be effectively addressed by focusing on just 20% of the available information. 

Here's how we applied the 80/20 rule:

- **Focus on the essentials**: We prioritized making sure the most important 20% of our documentation was top-notch and easily accessible.

- **Iterate and improve**: We started by tackling the most common problems and gradually expanded from there.

- **Manage technical debt**: We balanced quick fixes with building a system that would be easy to maintain in the long run.

<br>

Building an AI system like Wandbot involves balancing risks and rewards.

**Risks**:

- **Phased rollout**: We didn't launch Wandbot all at once. We started small and gradually expanded its use.
- **Addressing challenges**: We found ways to deal with inaccurate responses (by adding source citations), privacy concerns (by anonymizing data), and the need for human help (by making it easy for users to contact support).

<br>

**Rewards:**

- Happier users: People loved getting instant and accurate answers.
- Reduced support workload: Our support team had more time to focus on complex issues.
- Global reach: Wandbot provided expert assistance to users around the world, 24/7.

## Best Practices

Building a great RAG system like Wandbot involves following some important best practices. Here are some key lessons we learned:

**1. Start with a clear purpose:**

Define exactly what you want your RAG system to do.
Set specific goals and metrics to measure its success. For Wandbot, we wanted to improve how users navigate our documentation, so we tracked metrics like user satisfaction and search success rate.

**2. Ensure high-quality data:**

Your RAG system is only as good as the information it can access.
Make sure your knowledge base is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

**3. Embrace evaluation and iteration:**

Continuously test and evaluate your system's performance.~
Use the results to identify areas for improvement and make changes accordingly.

**4. Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework:**

Don't just focus on accuracy.`
Consider other factors like relevance, faithfulness to the source material, and user satisfaction.

**5. Involve subject matter experts:**

Even though LLMs are powerful, they can still make mistakes.
Have experts review the system's responses regularly to ensure they are accurate and make sense.

**6. Prioritize user experience:**

Design a user interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate.
Make it easy for users to find the information they need.

**7. Be transparent:**

Let users know they are interacting with a bot.
Provide citations for the information your system provides so users can verify it if they want.

**8. Commit to continuous improvement:**

User needs and information change over time.
Keep your knowledge base up-to-date and make ongoing improvements to your RAG system.

## Challenges & Solutions to evolving RAG pipelines

**1. The Ever-Changing Landscape of LLMs:**

One of the primary challenges we encountered was keeping pace with the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their associated APIs. New models and improved APIs are constantly being released, offering enhanced capabilities and performance. To ensure Wandbot remains at the forefront of this technological advancement, we adopted a systematic approach of regular updates and evaluations. This involves carefully integrating new LLM models and APIs into our system while rigorously testing and evaluating their impact on overall performance and stability.

**2. Balancing Feature Development with System Refinement:**

As with any software project, there's a constant tension between developing exciting new features and refining the core functionality of the existing system. We found it crucial to strike a balance between these two competing priorities. Our evaluation-driven framework proved instrumental in making informed decisions about which changes to prioritize. By carefully measuring the impact of both new features and system refinements on key performance indicators, we were able to allocate our development resources effectively and maximize the value delivered to our users.

**3. The Quest for Representative Evaluation Datasets:**

Developing truly representative evaluation datasets is a significant challenge in RAG development. These datasets are essential for accurately assessing the performance of the system in a way that reflects real-world usage patterns. We discovered that a combined approach yielded the most comprehensive insights: automated processes were used to gather large amounts of data, and this data was then supplemented by expert manual analysis of actual user chat logs. This hybrid approach allowed us to capture both the breadth and depth of user interactions, leading to more robust and meaningful evaluations.

**4. Navigating the Latency-Accuracy Trade-off:**

Optimizing the trade-off between response latency and accuracy is an ongoing challenge in RAG system development. Users expect both fast and accurate responses, but these two goals can sometimes be at odds. Reducing latency might involve simplifying the retrieval or generation process, which could potentially impact accuracy. Conversely, striving for higher accuracy might require more complex and time-consuming computations. We address this challenge through continuous fine-tuning of our system, exploring various techniques and configurations to improve both latency and accuracy simultaneously.

**5. Ensuring Continuous RAG System Evolution:**

- Building a RAG system is not a one-time effort. To remain effective and relevant, the system must continuously evolve. This ongoing development is crucial but often overlooked.

- Regular Dataset Updates: Keeping your datasets up-to-date is paramount. This goes beyond simply adding new information to the knowledge base. It also involves ensuring that your evaluation data accurately reflects the current state of your documentation and the types of queries real users are posing.

- Granular Evaluation: Don't just rely on overall system performance metrics. Take a more granular approach by evaluating individual components of your RAG system separately. This allows you to pinpoint specific areas where improvements are needed, leading to more targeted and effective optimizations.

- The Power of User Feedback: Quantitative metrics provide valuable insights, but they don't tell the whole story. Pay close attention to feedback from your users. This qualitative data often reveals nuanced issues and opportunities for improvement that numbers alone cannot capture.

- Fine-tuning the Entire RAG Pipeline: Regularly review and optimize every step of your RAG pipeline, from query processing and retrieval to re-ranking and response generation. This holistic approach ensures that all components of the system are working in harmony to deliver the best possible user experience.


## Evaluation

### The Ideal Evaluation Approach:

The goal is to build a small but highly representative evaluation dataset and leverage LLM judges to evaluate different components of your RAG system. By using techniques like LLM alignment (training LLMs to be better judges), we can push this mode of evaluation towards being both highly correlated with real-world performance and efficient enough for rapid iteration cycles.

### Types of Evaluation:

- **End-to-End (System) Evaluation:**

We start by evaluating the final response generated by the entire RAG pipeline. This is important because the response is often non-deterministic â€“ meaning it can vary even for the same input query. We typically compare the generated response against a "ground truth" or ideal response to assess its quality.

- **Component Evaluation:**

Since RAG systems have multiple parts (retrieval, re-ranking, generation), we also need to evaluate these components individually. This helps us pinpoint areas for improvement. For example, we might evaluate the retrieval system by comparing the retrieved context against a ground truth context or by asking an LLM to judge if the generated response is actually based on the retrieved context.

**Evaluation Without Ground Truth:**

Not all evaluations require ground truth. Here are some cases where we can evaluate without it:

- Direct Evaluation: We can measure specific aspects of a response directly. For example, we can use tools to assess the toxicity or racial bias of a generated response, or we can check if the response is grounded in the source text (e.g., by looking for citations).
- Pairwise Evaluation: We can compare two or more responses generated for the same query and judge which one is better based on criteria like tone, coherence, or informativeness.

**Evaluation with Ground Truth (Reference Evaluation):**

When we have a gold standard reference (a "correct" answer), we can perform reference evaluation. This is often used to evaluate the structure of a response or to check if it includes specific information that is expected.

### **Why It Is Used**
This metric leverages a language model to assess the quality of retrieval results beyond traditional metrics. It provides insights into both the average relevance of retrieved documents and the effectiveness of their ranking, enhancing the evaluation with advanced language understanding.

---

### Direct Evaluation with Heuristics:

Heuristics-based evaluation focuses on direct assessment without relying on ground truth answers. Here are some examples of structural checks you can implement:

- Check for specific elements: Does the response contain bullet points if the user asked for a list? Does it include code snippets if the query was about code?
- Enforce length constraints: Is the response within a reasonable length? Is it too short or too long?
- Validate structured output: If your RAG system is expected to generate structured output (e.g., JSON), you can check if the response is a valid JSON object.

These heuristics help enforce certain expectations about the output format, which can improve the robustness and reliability of your RAG system. They can catch obvious errors or inconsistencies before you move on to more sophisticated evaluation methods.

### Reference-Based Evaluation with Traditional Metrics:

For a more comprehensive evaluation of response quality, we can use reference-based evaluation. This involves comparing the generated response to a ground truth or reference response.

Here are some common metrics used in reference-based evaluation:

- Similarity Ratio: This measures the degree of overlap between the generated response and the reference response, often after normalizing the text (e.g., removing punctuation and converting to lowercase). A higher similarity ratio indicates a closer match.
- Levenshtein Distance: This metric calculates the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to transform the generated response into the reference response. A lower Levenshtein distance suggests a higher similarity.
- ROUGE and BLEU: These metrics (commonly used in machine translation and text summarization) also assess the overlap between generated text and reference text, but they consider different aspects like word sequences (ROUGE) and precision (BLEU).

---

## Limitations of Traditional Metrics:

While traditional metrics like similarity ratio and Levenshtein distance can be useful for evaluating generated text, they have limitations when it comes to assessing the quality of responses in RAG systems.

- Lack of Semantic Depth: Traditional metrics often focus on surface-level matching of words or phrases. They may not capture the deeper meaning or semantic nuances of the generated response. For example, two responses might have similar wording but convey different meanings, and traditional metrics might not be able to distinguish between them.
- Ignoring Contextual Relevance: Traditional metrics may not adequately consider the relationship between the generated response and the user's original query. A response might be grammatically correct and contain relevant keywords, but it might not actually answer the user's question in a meaningful way.
- Fuzzy Matching: The results of traditional metrics can sometimes be difficult to interpret because they often rely on fuzzy matching techniques. It might not be clear why a particular score was assigned or what aspects of the response contributed to that score.
- Subjectivity: Evaluating the quality of generated text, especially in complex tasks like question answering or dialogue generation, can be inherently subjective. What one person considers a good response, another might not. Traditional metrics may struggle to capture this subjectivity.

---

## LLM Evaluators: A More Nuanced Approach:

To overcome these limitations, we can turn to LLM evaluators. The idea is to leverage the power of LLMs to assess the quality and relevance of generated responses in a more sophisticated way.

How LLM Evaluators Work:

LLM evaluators are based on two key capabilities of large language models:

- Text Comparison: LLMs can effectively compare different pieces of text and identify similarities and differences in meaning and style.
- Instruction Following: LLMs can be trained to follow instructions and perform specific tasks, including evaluation.

The Process:

- Input: We provide the LLM evaluator with several pieces of information:
  - The retrieved context used by the RAG system.
  - The generated response.
  - The user's original query.
- Instructions/Scoring Criteria: We also give the LLM a set of instructions that outline the criteria it should use to evaluate the response. For example, we might tell the LLM to consider factors like relevance to the query, factual accuracy, coherence, and clarity.
- Evaluation: The LLM then uses its learned internal representations of language to compare the response to the context and the query, applying the provided scoring criteria.
- Output: The LLM outputs a score or a judgment (e.g., "good," "bad," "neutral") that reflects its assessment of the response quality.

Important Considerations:

- Determinism: LLM-generated scores might not be perfectly deterministic. Because LLMs are probabilistic models, they might produce slightly different scores for the same input on different runs.

- Evaluating the Evaluator: A key challenge is how to evaluate the LLM evaluator itself. If we're using an LLM to judge the quality of another LLM's output, how do we know if the evaluator is reliable and accurate? We'll address this question later in the chapter.

---

## LLM Evaluators: Limitations & Solutions:

Limitations 1: Non-Determinism:

LLM-generated scores can be non-deterministic. This means that if you run the same evaluation multiple times, you might get slightly different scores each time. This is because LLMs are probabilistic models â€“ their outputs are based on probabilities rather than strict rules.

Solutions: Multiple Trials:

To mitigate the issue of non-determinism, it's recommended to run multiple evaluation trials (e.g., 3-5) for each experiment and then average the scores. This provides a more stable and reliable estimate of the system's performance.

Limitation 2: Evaluating the Evaluator:

A key challenge with using LLMs as judges is determining how to evaluate the evaluator itself. If we're relying on an LLM to assess the quality of another LLM's output, how do we know if the evaluator is making accurate and reliable judgments?

Solution: Dedicated Evaluation Team:

Having a dedicated team or individuals focused on evaluation can significantly improve the quality and consistency of the evaluation process. This team can develop best practices, build and maintain evaluation datasets, and ensure that the LLM evaluator remains aligned with human judgment over time.

## Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

<img width="386" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e9b5dfe-c6c7-46f1-8256-9d69651537bc">

### Why is tokenization important?

- Context Windows: Language models have a limited context window â€“ the maximum number of tokens they can process at once. Accurate tokenization helps manage these windows effectively.
- Computational Costs: The number of tokens directly influences the computational resources required to run the RAG system. Accurate token counts help estimate these costs

### Why Clean the Text? Cleaning the text is vital for:

- Improving Retrieval Accuracy: Removing irrelevant characters or formatting helps the retrieval system focus on the meaningful content.
- Ensuring Smooth Tokenization: Special characters can sometimes disrupt the tokenization process, leading to errors or unexpected results.

### Retrieval Methods

**TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** This is a basic retrieval method. It assigns weights to terms in documents based on their frequency within the document and across the entire corpus.

**BM25 (Best Matching 25):** BM25 is a more advanced retrieval method that builds upon TF-IDF. It addresses some of the limitations of TF-IDF by:

- Considering Document Length: BM25 normalizes the term frequency based on the length of the document, preventing longer documents from being unfairly favored.
- Handling Term Frequency Saturation: BM25 uses a saturation function to prevent terms that appear very frequently in a document from having an overly strong influence on the relevance score.
- Probabilistic Model: BM25 employs a probabilistic model to estimate the relevance of documents to a query, making it more robust and accurate.

### The Three Pillars of Data Ingestion:

We can break down the data ingestion process into three core components, or pillars:

**Data Parsing:**

This is the first step, where we handle the variety of formats your data might come in. Whether it's PDFs, Word documents, web pages, or code files, data parsing converts them all into a standardized format that the RAG system can understand.

**Chunking:**

Once we have the data in a consistent format, we need to break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This is crucial for efficient retrieval. Instead of searching through entire documents, the RAG system can focus on smaller chunks that are more likely to contain the relevant information.

**Metadata Management:**

Metadata is like adding tags or labels to your data. It provides extra information about the content without requiring the system to read through everything. This can include things like the author, date, source, topic, or keywords associated with a particular chunk of data. Metadata helps the RAG system understand the context and relevance of the information, improving retrieval accuracy.

### Chunking 

**Semantic Chunking (aka Grouping by Meaning) **

Instead of dividing the text into fixed-length chunks, semantic chunking aims to group sentences together based on their meaning or topic.

It helps with: 

- Preserving Context: This method helps maintain the contextual relationships between sentences, ensuring that related information is kept together within a chunk.
- Adaptive Chunk Sizes: Chunk sizes can vary depending on the length of the semantic units in the text, resulting in more meaningful and coherent chunks.
- Semantic chunking can significantly improve the relevance of retrieved information. By keeping related sentences together, the RAG system is more likely to find chunks that contain the complete and relevant context for a given query.

**Hierarchical Chunking:** This involves creating a hierarchy of chunks, where parent chunks provide broader context and child chunks offer more specific details. This can be useful for representing different levels of information within a document.

**Small-to-Big Chunking:** This technique starts with small, focused chunks and then expands to include more context as needed. It can be particularly helpful for handling long sections of text.

### Metadata

Metadata is essentially data about your data. It's like the label on a jar that tells you what's inside without having to open it.

In RAG systems, we typically work with two types of metadata:

- Document Metadata: This provides information about the entire document, such as:
  - Title: The title of the document.
  - Source: Where the document came from (e.g., website, book, internal documentation).
  - Summary: A brief overview of the document's content.

- Chunk Metadata: This gives context to specific segments of text within a document, such as:
  - Structural Information: Is this chunk a header, a paragraph, a code block, etc.?
  - Programming Language (for Code): What programming language is used in this code chunk?
  - Version-Specific Information: Is this chunk relevant to a specific version of a product or software?
